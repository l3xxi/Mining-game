# Mining-game
A 2D voxel game - currently thinking of ideas; base gameplay is laid out, missing features, might be multiplayer



Ideas:
- Get some kind of seed system for generating worlds
- Spelunking with randomly generated caves, Terraria-esque but with cave collapse
- Mineshafts that need supports to stay, CoD Zombies gameplay, but if a mine collapses you cant repair it
- MULTIPLAYER (very good for the mineshaft idea or the cave one as well)
- Need more
